# Logger configuration
logger:
  # "panic" - highest level of severity. Logs and then calls panic with the
  # message passed to Debug, Info, ...

  # "fatal" - logs and then calls `logger.Exit(1)`. It will exit even if the
  # logging level is set to Panic.

  # "error" - logs. Used for errors that should definitely be noted.
  # Commonly used for hooks to send errors to an error tracking service.

  # "warning" - non-critical entries that deserve eyes.

  # "info" - general entries about what's going on inside the application.

  # "debug" - usually only enabled when debugging. Very verbose logging.

  # "trace" - designates finer-grained informational events than the Debug.
  level: "debug"
